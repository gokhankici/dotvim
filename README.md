# Welcome to my VIM configuration

I tried to maintain a simple vim environment with some plugins like NerdTree, Fugitive, CtrlP etc. and the [skittles_berry](https://github.com/shawncplus/skittles_berry) theme using vundle. Also xterm and screen supports are added.

# Installation:

    git clone https://github.com/gokhankici/dotvim.git ~/.vim

# Create symlinks:

    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
    ln -s ~/.vim/Xresources ~/.Xresources
    ln -s ~/.vim/screenrc ~/.screenrc
