# Welcome to my VIM configuration

I tried to maintain a simple vim environment with some plugins like NerdTree, Fugitive, CtrlP etc. and lots of themes using vundle. Also xterm, screen and tmux supports are added.

# Installation:

## Fetch the repositories

    git clone https://github.com/gokhankici/dotvim.git ~/.vim

## Create symlinks:

    cd ~/.vim
    bash install.sh

## Start vim:

At last, start vim and run the command ":BundleInstall". When installation is complete, restart vim.
